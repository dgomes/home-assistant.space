## Getting Started

### Author Pages

In order to properly generate author pages you need to rename the field *author* in the
front matter of every post to match that of your each author's *username* as defined
in the *[\_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml)* file.
With the latest update, multiple author blogs are now supported out of the box.

### Compiling Styles

Following on the way Casper styles are compiled as [described here](https://github.com/tryghost/casper#development):

Jasper2 styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node and Gulp installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

## Issues and Contributing

This install builds well with Ruby v2.4.2 and Jekyll v3.6.2. If you run into any problems
please log them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/myJekyll/jasper2/issues).

Feel free pull-request your patches and fixes.

## Thanks


Many thanks to the Ghost team for all the design work. 

Many thnaks to the [Jasper2](https://github.com/myJekyll/jasper2/) team for porting the Ghost theme to jekyll.
