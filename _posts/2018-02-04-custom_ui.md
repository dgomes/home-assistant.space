[Custom-UI](https://github.com/andrey-git/home-assistant-custom-ui) by [Andrey](https://github.com/andrey-git) is one of the few [User Interface ](https://home-assistant.io/cookbook/#user-interface)recipes.

The github repository contains detailed information on how to install and configure Custom-UI.

### What can be achieved with Custom-UI:
* Context-aware attributes
* Template attributes 
* Badges in state cards
* Per entity theming 
* Secondary custom UI
* Hiding entities from default view tab
* Show the last-changed text
* light, cover, "plain", and "toggle" cards can hide the controller altogether or add extra data
* Can add badge to the state card
* Confirmable controls

Personaly the "last-changed text" is a must have for anyone owning motion sensors. But also enjoy the per entity theming.

Andrey is also a core developer and many of Custom-UI features eventually move into the main repository.
